                        <p>Published in 1891, <em>El Filibusterismo</em> is the sequel to <em>Noli Me Tángere</em>, both written by Dr. José Rizal. The novel was written during Rizal's time in exile and reflects the growing dissatisfaction among Filipinos towards Spanish rule. Set in the late 19th century, it illustrates the continued oppression, exploitation, and abuses committed by Spanish authorities and the Catholic clergy.</p>

                        <p>One of the most significant historical events that influenced <em>El Filibusterismo</em> was the execution of the three Filipino priests—Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora—collectively known as Gomburza. Accused of inciting the 1872 Cavite Mutiny, they were executed, and their deaths fueled nationalist sentiments among Filipinos. Rizal dedicated <em>El Filibusterismo</em> to their memory, acknowledging their role in inspiring the fight for reform and justice.</p>

                        <p>The book was completed in Biarritz, France, in March 1891, and later published in Ghent, Belgium, despite Rizal's financial struggles. Upon publication, the Spanish government and Catholic Church banned the book due to its radical themes and criticisms of Spanish rule. However, it was secretly distributed in the Philippines, further encouraging the push for independence.</p>

                        <p><em>El Filibusterismo</em> takes place thirteen years after the events of <em>Noli Me Tángere</em> and follows the story of Crisóstomo Ibarra, now disguised as Simoun, a wealthy jeweler.

                        <p>Simoun secretly orchestrates plots to incite rebellion among Filipinos. His plan involves manipulating the corrupt government officials and friars by feeding their greed and ambition, all while plotting a large-scale uprising. One of his main schemes is to bomb a grand wedding banquet attended by high-ranking Spanish officials, using a lamp filled with explosives. However, his plan is thwarted by Isagani, a young poet and former lover of the bride, who learns of the plot and throws the lamp into the river, preventing the massacre.</p>

                        <p>As his plans fail, Simoun finds himself hunted by the authorities. He seeks refuge with Father Florentino, a respected Filipino priest. In their conversation, Simoun reveals his true identity and intentions, explaining his deep frustration with the slow progress of reform and the failure of peaceful means to bring about change. He ultimately takes his own life by ingesting poison. Before his death, Father Florentino reflects on the futility of violence and emphasizes that true freedom cannot be achieved through revenge, but through the moral and intellectual enlightenment of the people. He then disposes of Simoun's treasure into the sea, symbolizing the rejection of wealth and power as a means to liberation.</p>
